# Bad Apple on Python Turtle (Unfinished)
Probably worst possible way to watch Bad Apple


![Preview](preview-v0.5.gif)

This program draws every single frame of Bad Apple video inside Python Turtle Graphics,
 but since Turtle is incredibly slow, you'll see the end of it only after 4 hours. 
This project was made in one day, so I haven't figured out how to optimise drawing and get rid of weird lines across picture
